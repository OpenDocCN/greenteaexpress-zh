    if you know how to program, you can use that skill to learn other topics.

- en: Most books on Bayesian statistics use math notation and present ideas using
    mathematical concepts like calculus. This book uses Python code and discrete approximations
    instead of continuous mathematics. As a result, what would be an integral in a
    math book becomes a summation, and most operations on probability distributions
    are loops or array operations.

- en: I think this presentation is easier to understand, at least for people with
    programming skills. It is also more general, because when we make modeling decisions,
    we can choose the most appropriate model without worrying too much about whether
    the model lends itself to mathematical analysis.

- en: To start this book, you should be comfortable with Python. If you are familiar
    with NumPy and Pandas, that will help, but I’ll explain what you need as we go.
    You don’t need to know calculus or linear algebra. You don’t need any prior knowledge
    of statistics.

    is the foundation of Bayes’s Theorem. Chapter 3 introduces the probability distribution,
    which is the foundation of Bayesian statistics.

- en: In later chapters, we use a variety of discrete and continuous distributions,
    including the binomial, exponential, Poisson, beta, gamma, and normal distributions.
    I will explain each distribution when it is introduced, and we will use SciPy
    to compute them, so you don’t need to know about their mathematical properties.

- en: Most chapters in this book are motivated by a real-world problem, so they involve
    some degree of modeling. Before we can apply Bayesian methods (or any other analysis),
    we have to make decisions about which parts of the real-world system to include
    in the model and which details we can abstract away.

- en: For example, in Chapter 8, the motivating problem is to predict the winner of
    a soccer (football) game. I model goal-scoring as a Poisson process, which implies
    that a goal is equally likely at any point in the game. That is not exactly true,
    but it is probably a good enough model for most purposes.
  id: totrans-12

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think it is important to include modeling as an explicit part of problem solving
    because it reminds us to think about modeling errors (that is, errors due to simplifications
    and assumptions of the model).
  id: totrans-13
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many of the methods in this book are based on discrete distributions, which
    makes some people worry about numerical errors. But for real-world problems, numerical
    errors are almost always smaller than modeling errors.
  id: totrans-14

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, the discrete approach often allows better modeling decisions, and
    I would rather have an approximate solution to a good model than an exact solution
    to a bad model.
