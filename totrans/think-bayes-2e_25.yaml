    When I was working in Cambridge I took the Red Line from Kendall Square to South
    Station and caught the commuter rail to Needham. During rush hour Red Line trains
    run every 7–8 minutes, on average.

    train based on the number of passengers on the platform. If there were only a
    few people, I inferred that I just missed a train and expected to wait about 7
    minutes. If there were more passengers, I expected the train to arrive sooner.
    But if there were a large number of passengers, I suspected that trains were not
    running on schedule, so I would leave the subway stop and get a taxi.

    I will treat passenger arrivals as a Poisson process, which means I assume that
    passengers are equally likely to arrive at any time, and that they arrive at a
    rate, λ, measured in passengers per minute. Since I observe passengers during
    a short period of time, and at the same time every day, I assume that λ is constant.

    Boston are supposed to leave from the end of the line (Alewife station) every
    7–8 minutes during peak times, but by the time they get to Kendall Square, the
    time between trains varies between 3 and 12 minutes.

    data from the [MBTA](http://www.mbta.com/rider_tools/developers/), selects south-bound
    trains arriving at Kendall square, and records their arrival times in a database.
    I ran the script from 4 pm to 6 pm every weekday for 5 days, and recorded about
    15 arrivals per day. Then I computed the time between consecutive arrivals. Here
    are the gap times I recorded, in seconds.

- en: When the number of passengers is less than 20, we infer that the system is operating
    normally, so the probability of a long delay is small. If there are 30 passengers,
    we suspect that something is wrong and expect longer delays.

- en: If we are willing to accept a 5% chance of missing the connection at South Station,
    we should stay and wait as long as there are fewer than 30 passengers, and take
    a taxi if there are more.

  zh: 如果我们愿意接受在南站错过连接的概率为5%，我们应该等待，直到乘客少于30人，如果超过这个数量就应该乘坐出租车。
- en: Or, to take this analysis one step further, we could quantify the cost of missing
    the connection and the cost of taking a taxi, then choose the threshold that minimizes
    expected cost.

  zh: 或者，为了进一步分析，我们可以量化错过连接的成本和乘坐出租车的成本，然后选择最小化预期成本的阈值。
- en: This analysis is based on the assumption that the arrival rate, `lam`, is known.
    If it is not known precisely, but is estimated from data, we could represent our
    uncertainty about `lam` with a distribution, compute the distribution of `y` for
    each value of `lam`, and make a mixture to represent the distribution of `y`.
    I did that in the version of this problem in the first edition of *Think Bayes*;
    I left it out here because it is not the focus of the problem.

  zh: 这种分析是基于到达率“lam”已知的假设。如果它不是精确已知的，而是从数据中估计出来的，我们可以用分布表示对“lam”的不确定性，计算每个“lam”值的“y”的分布，并进行混合以表示“y”的分布。我在《Bayes思维》第一版中的这个问题的版本中做过这样的处理；我在这里没有提到，因为这不是问题的重点。
