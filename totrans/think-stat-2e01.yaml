- en: I present most ideas using Python code, rather than mathematical notation. In
    general, Python code is more readable; also, because it is executable, readers
    can download it, run it, and modify it.

    learning. When you write programs, you express your understanding in code; while
    you are debugging the program, you are also correcting your understanding.

- en: Some exercises involve experiments to test statistical behavior. For example,
    you can explore the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) by generating random samples and
    computing their sums. The resulting visualizations demonstrate why the CLT works
    and when it doesn’t.

    For example, we approximate p-values by running random simulations, which reinforces
    the meaning of the p-value.

    readers can import data from almost any source. They are not limited to datasets

    object-oriented features, but not pandas, NumPy, and SciPy.

    many of them substantially revised, and new chapters on regression, time series
    analysis, survival analysis, and analytic methods. The previous edition did not
    use pandas, SciPy, or StatsModels, so all of that material is new.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When people write a new textbook, they usually start by reading a stack of old
    textbooks. As a result, most books contain the same material in pretty much the
    same order.

- en: 'I did not do that. In fact, I used almost no printed material while I was writing
    this book, for several reasons:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    exposure to existing approaches.

    sure that no part of it was encumbered by copyright restrictions.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many readers of my books don’t have access to libraries of printed material,
    so I tried to make references to resources that are freely available on the Internet.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some proponents of old media think that the exclusive use of electronic resources
    is lazy and unreliable. They might be right about the first part, but I think
    they are wrong about the second, so I wanted to test my theory.

- en: The resource I used more than any other is Wikipedia. In general, the articles
    I read on statistical topics were very good (although I made a few small changes
    along the way). I include references to Wikipedia pages throughout the book and
    I encourage you to follow those links; in many cases, the Wikipedia page picks
    up where my description leaves off. The vocabulary and notation in this book are
    generally consistent with Wikipedia, unless I had a good reason to deviate. Other
    resources I found useful were Wolfram MathWorld and the Reddit statistics forum,
    [http://www.reddit.com/r/statistics](http://www.reddit.com/r/statistics).

    Python distribution that includes all the packages you’ll need to run the code
    (and lots more). I found Anaconda easy to install. By default it does a user-level
    installation, so you don’t need administrative privileges. You can download Anaconda

    Python distributions that include these packages.
