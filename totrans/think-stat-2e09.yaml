    example, suppose we are estimating the distribution of wind speeds at a building
    site. If the estimate is too high, we might overbuild the structure, increasing

    harmful to the gorillas. But if it is important to obtain this information, it

    estimator L[m], RMSE is 1.8\. We can’t tell from this experiment whether L minimizes
    MSE, but at least it seems better than L[m].

  zh: 当我用λ=2运行这个实验时，L的RMSE为1.1。对于基于中位数的估计量L[m]，RMSE为1.8。从这个实验中我们无法判断L是否最小化了MSE，但至少它似乎比L[m]更好。
- en: Sadly, it seems that both estimators are biased. For L the mean error is 0.33;
    for L[m] it is 0.45\. And neither converges to 0 as `m` increases.
