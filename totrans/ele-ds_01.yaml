- en: This book is in the form of Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter is a software development
    tool you can run in a web browser, so you don’t have to install any software.
    A Jupyter notebook is a document that contains text, Python code, and results.
    So you can read it like a book, but you can also modify the code, run it, develop
    new programs, and test them.

    Using data from the General Social Survey, this case study explore changing opinions
    on a variety of topics among survey respondents in the United States. Readers
    choose one of about 120 survey questions and see how responses have changed over
    time and how these changes relate to political alignment (conservative, moderate,
    or liberal).'

    This case study is based on a well known paper, “Machine Bias”, which was published
    by Politico in 2016\. It relates to COMPAS, a statistical tool used in the criminal
    justice system to assess the risk that a defendant will commit another crime if
    released. The ProPublica article concludes that COMPAS is unfair to Black defendants
    because they are more likely to be misclassified as high risk. A response article
    in the Washington Post suggests that “It’s actually not that clear.” Using the
    data from the original article, this case study explains the (many) metrics used
    to evaluate binary classifiers, shows the challenges of defining algorithmic fairness,
    and starts a discussion of the context, ethics, and social impact of data science.'
